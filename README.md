# Greetings! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Alexander, but you may know me as **Allkams** in the online world. Currently, I'm a student pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer game programming at LuleÃ¥ University of Technology (LTU). My area of expertise lies in C++ and C#, which I apply while creating games and taking up exciting challenges. I try to frequently participate in GameJams, and on top of that, I'm running a YouTube series, where I'm building my very own Rendering Engine called "SpectraWise".

## Cool Projects
[SpectraWise Engine](): A OpenGL renderer made with C++ and CMake.

... More on the way ðŸ˜Ž

## Current Learnings
Right now, I'm immersed in the world of CMake and OpenGL rendering. I'm deeply fascinated by graphical rendering and aspire to develop a rendering engine using OpenGL and Vulkan.  
Every step I take is a leap forward in my learning journey, and I'm excited to see where it takes me!

## Interest 
Allow me to introduce myself as a person with diverse interests, but let's focus on the ones that matter the most to me. In the realm of computers, I find games, optimization, and rendering techniques incredibly captivating. Additionally, I have a keen eye for design, drawing, and similar artistic endeavors. However, my greatest passion lies in Parkour, as it allows me to explore the real world and push my limits without fear of any challenge being too daunting. Nothing can hold me back when it comes to trying new things and embracing the art of movement!
