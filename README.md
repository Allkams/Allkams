# Greetings! ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my GitHub profile! My name is Alexander, known online as Allkams. I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Computer Game Programming. My primary expertise is in C++ and C#, which I leverage to create engaging games and tackle complex programming challenges.

I actively participate in GameJams to hone my skills and collaborate with the game development community. Additionally, I am developing a custom Rendering Engine, SpectraWise, where I explore advanced graphics programming and optimization solutions using OpenGL, with plans to incorporate Vulkan.

Feel free to explore my repositories and projects. Let's connect and collaborate to push the boundaries of programming!

## ðŸ’¼ Skills
- Programming Languages: C++, C#, Python
- Game Development: Unity, Unreal Engine
- Graphics Programming: OpenGL, Vulkan (learning)
- Tools: CMake, Blender, Visual Studio Code
- Management tools: Notion, Hansoft
- Documentation tools: Confluence
- Version Controls: Git, Github, Perforce
- 3D Printing/Modeling: Bambulab X1 Carbon

## ðŸ“‚ Cool Projects

## ðŸ“š Current Learnings 
At present, I am delving into the intricacies of CMake and OpenGL rendering. My journey into graphical rendering has been deeply fascinating, and I am committed to mastering these technologies. My current focus is on developing a robust rendering engine using OpenGL, with future plans to incorporate Vulkan for enhanced performance and capabilities.

## ðŸŽ¨ Interest 
While my professional focus is on computer game programming, my interests span a variety of fields. In the realm of computing, I am particularly captivated by game development, optimization, and advanced rendering techniques. Beyond the digital world, I enjoy creative pursuits such as design and drawing, which complement my technical skills. My greatest passion, however, lies in Parkour and Movement. This discipline allows me to explore the physical world, challenge my limits, and embrace every obstacle as an opportunity for growth.
